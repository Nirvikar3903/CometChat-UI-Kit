#CometChat UI Components Feedback

CometChat UI Components are a great choice if you're looking to add chat functionality quickly without starting from scratch. They provide a good balance of flexibility and ease of use, especially if you're familiar with React or similar frameworks. However, there are a few areas that could be improved,  which I’ll outline below.

#Pros / Advantages
1.Quick Integration
.Perfect for developers who want to add chat features quickly.
.Reduces the time it takes to get started compared to using the SDK alone.

2.Reduced Boilerplate Code
.The components manage the internal data flow and state handling, so you don’t have to deal with repetitive SDK calls.
.This reduces the amount of boilerplate code you need to write and helps speed up development.

3.Built-in Chat Logic
.Each component handles essential chat features like sending messages, displaying typing indicators, and fetching messages.
.You don’t need to worry about writing these core features yourself, which speeds up development.


#Areas for Improvement
1.Styling Flexibility
While customization is possible, overriding default styles can be challenging. You may need to use complex CSS overrides or dig into the source code to fully adjust the design to match your app’s branding.

2.Limited Customization Options
Some components have restricted customization capabilities, particularly when it comes to altering internal structures or adding new props. You may need to rely on the SDK for more complex customizations.

3.Documentation Gaps
The documentation could be more detailed, especially when it comes to config files  Developers may spend extra time experimenting or seeking support for more advanced configurations.
This was encountered while integrating ts.config file even it doesnot cause any issue in deploying app 

4.Auth Key Issues
There are occasional issues with the auth key, where syncing or authentication can be inconsistent. This can lead to unexpected failures, especially with user login or access permissions.

5.Scrollbar Behavior
The scrollbar can behave unexpectedly, particularly when dealing with long chat histories or new messages. This can result in a subpar user experience if the scrollbar doesn’t update or scroll smoothly.



# More specified 
1. Dashboard Terminology (MAU, CCU)
Issue: The terms "MAU" (Monthly Active Users) and "CCU" (Concurrent Users) on the dashboard are not easily understood by all users, especially those unfamiliar with industry jargon.
Suggestion: Adding an eye button (tooltip or info icon) next to these terms that provides a short description or explanation when hovered over or clicked can help clarify their meaning and improve the user experience.

2.Auth Key Exposure:
.While integrating CometChat, I noticed that the Auth Key is directly exposed in the frontend for client-side use. 
.This can be a potential security risk, since anything on the frontend can be easily inspected and extracted.
.Suggestion: It would be better if a more secure method is offered — maybe using tokens that expire quickly, or allowing backend token exchanges — to reduce the risk of key leakage.

3.UI Responsiveness Issue:
.On a common laptop screen size (around 1536×730), the chat layout doesn't fit properly.
.0Both horizontal and vertical scrollbars appear even when there’s no actual content overflow, making the interface feel less polished.
.Suggestion: Adjust the layout to fit typical viewport sizes better — maybe using max-width: 100% / max-height: 100% or media queries to prevent unnecessary scrollbars.
