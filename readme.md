#  CometChat UI Components Feedback

---

CometChat UI Components are a **great choice** if you're looking to add chat functionality quickly without starting from scratch. They offer a nice balance of **flexibility** and **ease of use**, especially for developers familiar with **React** or similar frameworks.  
However, there are a few areas that could be improved, which I’ll outline below.

---

##  Pros / Advantages

- **1.Quick Integration**  
  Perfect for developers who want to add chat features quickly. Greatly reduces setup time compared to using the SDK alone.

- **2.Reduced Boilerplate Code**  
  The components manage the internal data flow and state handling, so you don’t have to deal with repetitive SDK calls.

- **3.Built-in Chat Logic**  
  Each component handles essential features like sending messages, displaying typing indicators, and fetching messages automatically.

##  Areas for Improvement

- **Styling Flexibility**  
  While customization is possible, overriding default styles can be challenging. It often requires complex CSS overrides or digging into source code.

- **Limited Customization Options**  
  Some components restrict altering internal structures or adding new props, making advanced customization difficult without falling back to the SDK.

- **Documentation Gaps**  
  The documentation could be more detailed, especially regarding configuration files (e.g., `tsconfig.json`).  
  _(Note: Even though it doesn't block app deployment, it causes confusion during integration.)_

- **Auth Key Issues**  
  Exposing the Auth Key directly in the frontend can lead to security risks and potential misuse if extracted.

- **Scrollbar Behavior**  
  Scrollbars appear unexpectedly when dealing with long chat histories or new messages, affecting the user experience.

##  More Specific Issues

### 1.  Dashboard Terminology (MAU, CCU)
- **Issue:**  
  The terms **MAU** (Monthly Active Users) and **CCU** (Concurrent Users) are not clearly explained, which can confuse users unfamiliar with industry jargon.
- **Suggestion:**  
  Add an **info icon** (`ℹ️`) or tooltip next to these terms for quick explanations.

### 2.  Auth Key Exposure
- **Issue:**  
  The **Auth Key** is directly exposed in the frontend, making it vulnerable through browser inspection.
- **Suggestion:**  
  Implement a **more secure method**, like short-lived access tokens or server-side authentication exchanges.

---

### 3.  UI Responsiveness Issue
- **Issue:**  
  On a **standard laptop screen size** (~1536×730), both **horizontal** and **vertical scrollbars** appear unnecessarily.
- **Suggestion:**  
  Improve layout responsiveness using `max-width: 100%`, `max-height: 100%`, and better media queries to avoid overflow.
